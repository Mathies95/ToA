Consider a problem of determining the best sequencing of jobs on a machine. A set of startup costs are given for 5 machines:

```{r}
startup_costs <- c(27, 28, 32, 35, 26)
startup_costs
```

Moreover, when changing from one job to another job the setup costs are given as:

```{r}
setup_costs <- matrix(c(
  NA, 35, 22, 44, 12,
  49, NA, 46, 38, 17,
  46, 12, NA, 29, 41,
  23, 37, 31, NA, 26,
  17, 23, 28, 34, NA), 
  byrow = T, nrow = 5)
setup_costs
```

The goal of the problem is to determine a sequence of jobs which minimizes the total setup cost including the startup cost.

One possible way to find a sequence is the use a greedy strategy:

```
Greedy Algorithm
Step 0: Start with the job which has minimal startup cost.
Step 1: Select the next job as the job not already done 
        with minimal setup cost given current job. 
Step 2: Set next job in Step 1 to current job and 
        go to Step 1 if not all jobs are done.
```

The greedy algorithm can be implemented as:

```{r}
greedy <- function(startup, setup) {
  jobs <- nrow(setup)
  cur_job <- which.min(startup)
  cost <- startup[cur_job]
  cat("Start job:", cur_job, "\n")
  job_seq <- cur_job
  setup[, cur_job] <- NA
  # browser()
  for (i in 1:(jobs-1)) {
    next_job <- which.min(setup[cur_job, ])
    cat("Next job:", next_job, "\n") 
    cost <- cost + setup[cur_job, next_job]
    job_seq <- c(job_seq, next_job)
    cur_job <- next_job
    setup[, cur_job] <- NA
  }
  # print(setup)
  return(list(seq = job_seq, cost = cost))
}
greedy(startup_costs, setup_costs)
```

First, the job with minimum startup cost is found using function `which.min` and we define cost a the startup cost. We use `cat` to make some debugging statements and initialize `job_seq` with the first job. Next we have to have a way ignoring jobs already done. We do that here by setting the columns of setup cost equal to NA for jobs already done. Hence they will not be selected by `which.min`. The `for` loop runs 4 times and selects jobs and accumulate the total cost.


## Question 1

A well-known better strategy is to:

```
Better Algorithm
Step 0: Subtract minimum of startup and setup cost for each job from setup and 
        startup costs (that is columnwise)
Step 1: Call the greedy algorithm with the modified costs. Note that the total 
        cost returned has to be modified a bit.
```

*Implement a `better` function calculating a better strategy. Hint: to find the minimum column costs you may use `apply(rbind(startup, setup), 2, min, na.rm = T)`.*

The function becomes:

```{r}
better <- function(startup, setup) {
  jobs <- nrow(setup)
  min_col_val <- apply(rbind(startup, setup), 2, min, na.rm = T)
  startup <- startup - min_col_val
  min_mat <- matrix(rep(min_col_val, jobs), 
                    ncol = jobs, byrow = T)
  setup <- setup - min_mat
  lst <- greedy(startup, setup)
  lst$cost <- lst$cost + sum(min_col_val)
  return(lst)
}
```

If we run the function the job sequence becomes:

```{r}
res <- better(startup_costs, setup_costs)
```

That is we use job sequence `r res$seq` with a cost of `r res$cost`.


## Question 2

*Assume that the startup costs are 27, 28, 55, 120 and 26 instead. How will that affect the job sequence using the better strategy?*

We modify the startup costs and run `better`:

```{r}
startup_costs <- c(27, 28, 55, 120, 26)
res <- better(startup_costs, setup_costs)
```

The job sequence now becomes `r res$seq` with a cost of `r res$cost`.


## Question 3

*Make a plot of the job sequence*

```{r, layout="l-body-outset", fig.asp = 0.25, eval=FALSE}
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)
edges <- tibble(from = res$seq[1:4], to = res$seq[2:5])
graph <- as_tbl_graph(edges) 
ggraph(graph, layout = 'linear') + 
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, 'mm')), 
                 end_cap = circle(4, 'mm'), 
                 start_cap  = circle(4, 'mm')) + 
  geom_node_point(colour = "gray", size = 9, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label=name)) +
  theme_graph()
```
